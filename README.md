# Block Form Submissions per Domain

Hi! I'm a fun piece of code that gives you the ability to block an html form submission from any domain of your choosing. I'm highly customizable and if you're I bet you're smart enough to get me to work just the way you want.

I was originally written with the intention of GreenArrow services and their basic submission forms but if you check out my code I know you can figure out a way to get me to work with whatever html forms you're using.

The code you'll see here in my repository comes in three files but my creator often puts me into existing web projects he has. There's really no need to download the files I have available here and try to use me as a stand-alone creation.
